# Text Analysis with Python and NLTK

## Abstract

Digital technologies have made vast amounts of text available to researchers, and this same technological moment has provided us with the capacity to analyze that text faster than humanly possible. The first step in that analysis is to transform texts designed for human consumption into a form a computer can analyze. Using Python and the Natural Language ToolKit (commonly called NLTK), this workshop introduces strategies to turn qualitative texts into quantitative objects. Through that process, we will present a variety of strategies for simple analysis of text-based data.

## Learning Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn skills like:

- How to prepare texts for computational analysis, including strategies for transforming texts into numbers
- How to use NLTK methods such as `concordance` and `similar`
- How to clean and standardize your data, including powerful tools such as stemmers and lemmatizers
- Compare frequency distribution of words in a text to quantify the narrative arc
- Understand stop words and how to remove them when needed.
- Utilize Part-of-Speech tagging to gather insights about a text
- Transform any document that you have (or have access to) in a .txt format into a text that can be analyzed computationally
- How to tokenize your data and put it in nltk compatible format.

## Estimated time

### Ethical Considerations

- In working with massive amounts of text, it is natural to lose the original context. We must be aware of that and be careful when analizing it.
- It is important to constantly question our assumptions and the indexes we are using. Numbers and graphs do not tell the story, our analysis does. We must be careful not to draw hasty and simplistic conclusions for things that are complex. Just because we found out that author A uses more unique words than author B, does it mean that A is a better writer than B?
